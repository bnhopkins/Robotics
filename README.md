# Performing Robots


## Robotic Performance
Glowing tetrahedron suspended in space within a concrete chamber. A performance of the audience and the space interacting through light robotics. The robots respond to the audience through sensors and seek to engage the audience through childlike curiosity. This performance by Ruairi Glynn took place at the Tate Modern.

## Update on Robot

## Response to Today’s Disussion
Some interesting tidbits...

[Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics"](https://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html)
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Maybe our class should make the world record in Abu Dhabi ;)


## Interesting Artist : Eric Siu
![Eric Siu](ericsiu.jpg)
[Eric Siu](http://ericsiu.net/) has done some really interesting work in the space of new media robticesque art.
The project above is called touchy. "Touchy is a human camera – a wearable device that literally transforms a human being into a functioning camera. The wearer is constantly “blinded” unless someone touches his/her skin that causes the shutters to open and restores the wearer’s vision. When physical contact is held for 10 seconds, the camera takes a “Touch-Snap”, which is displayed on the device’s LCD."


## Some thoughts on cybernetics
[Claude Shannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Whj_nL-x8)

As we start out in the this class discussing cybernetics, I think it is interesting to go back to one of the original people who started it all in the world of communication.

## Bluetooth Module Update

## Orlando

While in Orlando, I went to OMART, Orlando Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition was a very cool new media exhibition.

## Idea for final project

## Fritz
#### Things that could have been better
the robot created for open studios was stupendous! However, there could have been a better use of space. Also, many of the pieces were not quite coordinated, and it could have been nice if the dragon and durm were coordinated. 



## Detailed plan for actor

#### Areas of greatest risk or uncertainty
Risk: Creating smooth transitions and motions of actors
Uncertainity: story line

#### Mechanical
There will be a play or story that culminates in the death of an actor.
Necessary for performance
- create sustainable actors, ensure they wont fall apart
- pushing a button with a robotic arm

#### Electronics
We will create three main robot actors, one be a head on the wall head:
- 3 Arduino uno
- printed PCB board to clean up electronics
- switch for actor
- light sensor
- Adafruit bluetooth module
- large button

#### Software
- program motions and actions into actor
- integrate speech element into actor

#### Power
The actors will have batteries will attatched, and these should be able to last the durration of the performance.

#### Parts list
The scenes will need to be designed and fabricated:
- wood
- possibly paint?

#### Organizational
Use readme for updates, wiki for project documentation

## Discussion with Michael
LED to signify dying?
Servos
think about degrees of freedom
