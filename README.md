# Performing Robots


## Robotic Performance
Glowing tetrahedron suspended in space within a concrete chamber. A performance of the audience and the space interacting through light robotics. The robots respond to the audience through sensors and seek to engage the audience through childlike curiosity. This performance by Ruairi Glynn took place at the Tate Modern.

# Response to Today’s Disussion
Some interesting tidbits...

[Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics"](https://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html)
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Maybe our class should make the world record in Abu Dhabi ;)


# Interesting Artist : Eric Siu
![Eric Siu](ericsiu.jpg)
[Eric Siu](http://ericsiu.net/) has done some really interesting work in the space of new media robticesque art.
The project above is called touchy. "Touchy is a human camera – a wearable device that literally transforms a human being into a functioning camera. The wearer is constantly “blinded” unless someone touches his/her skin that causes the shutters to open and restores the wearer’s vision. When physical contact is held for 10 seconds, the camera takes a “Touch-Snap”, which is displayed on the device’s LCD."


# Some thoughts on cybernetics

As we start out in the this class discussing cybernetics, I think it is interesting to go back to one of the original people who started it all in the world of communication.

# Orlando

While in Orlando, I went to OMART, Orlando Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition was a very cool new media exhibition.
