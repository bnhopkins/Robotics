#Performing Robots


##Robotic Performance
Glowing tetrahedron suspended in space within a concrete chamber. A performance of the audience and the space interacting through light robotics. The robots respond to the audience through sensors and seek to engage the audience through childlike curiosity. This performance by Ruairi Glynn took place at the Tate Modern.

#Response to Todayâ€™s Disussion
Some interesting tidbits...
[Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics"](https://www.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html)
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Maybe our class should make the world record in Abu Dhabi ;)
