Final Project

Concept
The performance was meant to capture the aura of the tension between powerful elite and the working class, particularly in the current time as it feels like this gap is widening. To do this, we used a combination of sound, movement and visuals to create a rising tension and sense of anxiety and unease. 

Materials
The materials used in the construction of the robot were quite varied, as at each stage of the process there were many prototypes and experiments of different materials. I was primarily responsible for the design and creation of the conveyor belt. This was a table 

To complete the project, I had to learn a lot of building and engineering techniques. I lea I also became a pro using the laser cutter. 

Electrical
The electrical component of the project consisted of running the DC motors for the conveyor belt. I kept these at a constant speed. I also created a clock to go along with it. This motor was a basic spinning 

Mechanical
The mechanical aspect of the conveyor belt was more complex. I

Challenges

The main challenge I faced was making the two rollers of the conveyor belt parallel.
Additionally, I made the top surface of the conveyor belt acryllic, which proved more difficult to work with than I imagined, in terms of screwing other elements into the board.
Finally, Creating rollers that adequately pulled the conveyor belt without getting stuck from too much friction, and not being too smooth, was a challenge. In the end I cut strips of sand paper to wrap around a pool noodle and this worked well. Attatching anything to the pool noodle was also a challenge because glue or screws would just rip out.


## Detailed plan for actor

#### Areas of greatest risk or uncertainty
Risk: Creating smooth transitions and motions of actors
Uncertainity: story line

#### Mechanical
There will be a play or story that culminates in the death of an actor.
Necessary for performance
- create sustainable actors, ensure they wont fall apart
- pushing a button with a robotic arm

#### Electronics
We will create three main robot actors, one be a head on the wall head:
- 3 Arduino uno
- printed PCB board to clean up electronics
- switch for actor
- light sensor
- Adafruit bluetooth module
- large button

#### Software
- program motions and actions into actor
- integrate speech element into actor

#### Power
The actors will have batteries will attatched, and these should be able to last the durration of the performance.

#### Parts list
The scenes will need to be designed and fabricated:
- wood
- possibly paint?

#### Organizational
Use readme for updates, wiki for project documentation

LED to signify dying?

think about degrees of freedom

## Nov 21 Update

##### Project description to date: 
We have decdied to pursue a "Charlie Chaplin Modern times" esq scene with one robot as the "proliteriate" robot that is on the assembly line as a worker and another "capitalist" boss that is telling the robot what to do faster and faster until the robot starts to fall apart and almost die. Then the audience is given the option to kill the boss robot, and the manaquin on the wall forcing the robot to work dies.

##### Greatest risk or uncertainty
The robot actions will be the hardest part. We have to figure out how to lift a stamp and stamp the stamp.

##### Detailed parts list
###### "Worker" Robot
- Paper body, possibly also made with cloth
- Paper mach√© / plaster face
- Step motor for turning body (need stronger motors)
- Step motor lifting arm (need stronger motors)
- Motor shield
- 1 arduino uno (Arduino will handle both motors, fine because the delays will be at appropriate times. As the motor lifts the hand up, the other motor will be still and visa versa)
- Bluetooth module (for manual override)
- String/wire to pull the hand up

###### "Capitalist" Robot
- Manaquin body
- Cloth head

###### Background pipes
- Black paper
- Cardboard
- Step/Servo Motor
- Arduino

###### Clock
- White paper
- Black plastic/paper for clock hands
- Arduino (could potentially share with background pipes)

##### Electronic and electromechanical items not figured out
- How to lift the arm

##### Hand drawn sketch & Block diagram of the electronics
![Diagram](diagram.JPG)

##### Outline of programs
###### "Worker" Robot
1. lift stamp
2. turn right 35 degrees 
3. put stamp in ink
4. lift stamp
5. turn left 70 degrees 
6. stamp
7. turn right 70 degrees

###### "Capitalist" Robot
No robotic movements (only speaking and projection)

###### Background pipes
1. move forward/ upwards
2. delay
3. move backwards/downwards
4. delay

###### Clock
1. start motor
2. move forward
3. with manual commands (bluetooth), move faster

##### Interactive Element
For our performance, we will ask the audience to decide if we should kill the "capitalist" robot or not. This will be in the form of a website. The audience input will not actually decide the fate of the robot, but rather it will be a tool to engage the audience and make them think hard about the direction the play should proceed in.
